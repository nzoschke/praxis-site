# Introduction

Hello this is a change in a branch.

Convox Praxis is a universal infrastructure interface. When you develop and deploy applications using Praxis you completely abstract away concerns about where your application is running. Whether itâ€™s running on your laptop or in the cloud, its configuration and your interactions with it will be the same. This allows you to focus exclusively on developing your application to solve your business challenges rather than thinking about low-level operations.

Praxis abstracts away the underlying infrastructure by providing a set of universal primitives, a simple file format to configure them, and a standard API to interact with them. This guide will walk you through each of these concepts to give you the full set of tools you need to start developing and deploying your applications.
